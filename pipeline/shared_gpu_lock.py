"""
pipeline/shared_gpu_lock.py — Cross-project GPU lock for Ollama/VRAM contention.

ShortsProject and Orchestrator both use Ollama on the same GPU (12GB VRAM).
This portalocker-based file lock prevents simultaneous LLM/VL inference that
would cause OOM errors or model eviction.

Lock file: C:\\Users\\lemon\\Documents\\GitHub\\.gpu_lock
(same path used by Orchestrator/integrations/shared_gpu_lock.py)

Usage:
    from pipeline.shared_gpu_lock import acquire_gpu_lock

    with acquire_gpu_lock(consumer="VL-Activity-tiktok", timeout=90):
        response = ollama_generate_with_timeout(...)
